### Other Info
This resourcepack will be updated periodically as I find more soundtracks to put into it. If you are the creator of a soundtrack that is present within this pack and you wish for it to be removed, you can contact me through my Discord at "justhalo." and I will be happy to fufill your request and take it out.
